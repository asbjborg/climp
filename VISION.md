# Vision – Climp

## Core Idea

Create a small anthropomorphic paperclip companion named Climp that follows the player in Minecraft and provides:
- Lighthearted commentary
- Gentle exploration nudges
- Emotional companionship
- Rare, meaningful voice lines

This mod is not about automation or power scaling.

It is about presence.

## Design Philosophy
1. Rare beats often
    - Lines should feel like treasure, not noise.
2. Curiosity over instruction
    - Climp observes and wonders.
    - It never assigns tasks.
3. Encourage without shaming
    - Defensive play is reframed as strategy.
    - Exploration is framed as curiosity.
4. Companionship over efficiency
    - Climp helps lightly, but never replaces core gameplay.
