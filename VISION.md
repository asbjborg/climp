# Vision – The Paperclip Imp

## Core Idea

Create a small anthropomorphic paperclip companion that follows the player in Minecraft and provides:
- Lighthearted commentary
- Gentle exploration nudges
- Emotional companionship
- Rare, meaningful voice lines

This mod is not about automation or power scaling.

It is about presence.

⸻

## Design Philosophy
1. Rare beats often
    - Lines should feel like treasure, not noise.
2. Curiosity over instruction
    - The imp observes and wonders.
    - It never assigns tasks.
3. Encourage without shaming
    - Defensive play is reframed as strategy.
    - Exploration is framed as curiosity.
4. Companionship over efficiency
    - The imp helps lightly, but never replaces core gameplay.

⸻

## Emotional Goal
- Reduce loneliness during early survival.
- Turn fear moments into humor.
- Reinforce bravery subtly.
- Create memorable first-night experiences.

⸻

## Long-Term Possibilities (Not MVP)
- Exploration tracking
- Biome awareness
- Rare “legendary” lines
- Mood states
- Upgrade tiers
- Cosmetic voice packs
- Secret scavenger triggers
- Subtle bravery reinforcement moments
