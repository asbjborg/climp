# Backlog

Raw idea dump. No structure required — add anything that might be worth building later. When something becomes a real task, we track it in [WORK.md](WORK.md).

## Command rod / adventuring stick

A cane or stick item you carry (like a walking stick irl). Used to "send Climp off" to do simple tasks. Reduces day‑1 time pressure before first night.

- **First use case:** send Climp to chop down a tree so you can focus on shelter/food.
- Post‑MVP; fits "moderately helpful, structurally flexible."
