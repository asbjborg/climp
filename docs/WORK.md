# Work

Working doc: current focus and tasks. Tasks can reference items in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md). When we start one, we add a task here; when it’s done, we strike it and record it in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Current focus

- *(No active tasks right now.)*

## Tasks (backlog)

- [ ] *(Add tasks here when we pick something from BACKLOG.md)*

---

*Example: “- [ ] Command rod item (→ BACKLOG.md § Command rod)”*
