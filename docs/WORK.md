# Work

**In-progress only.** This is the todo list for active work. Tasks reference [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) and **link to the idea doc** under `docs/backlog/`. When we pick an idea, we add a task here (with that link). When it's fully done—documented in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) (with the idea-doc link) and released with a version—we **remove** it from here. WORK holds no history; done work lives in CHANGELOG.
