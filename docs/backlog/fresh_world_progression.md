# Natural Progression Roadmap (Fresh World Testing)

## Goal

Structure feature development around the natural early-game progression of a brand new Minecraft world. This enables live, in-context testing while playing from day 1 with Ellia.

---

## Phase 1 - Day 0-1 (Spawn and Survival Setup)

- Climp introduction moment on world load.
- First-day commentary (wood gathering, crafting wooden axe).
- Light "panic burrow" humor during first shelter dig.
- Simple encouragement during first night.

## Phase 2 - Early Resource Discovery

- Trigger: first coal found.
- Trigger: first iron found.
- Trigger: first diamond found.
- Subtle nudge if no bucket after several days.
- Rare excitement lines for first shiny discoveries.

## Phase 3 - Early Exploration Expansion

- Track max distance from spawn.
- Gentle curiosity lines if staying near spawn too long.
- Biome discovery reactions (ocean, mountain, cave).
- First ocean arrival excitement moment.

## Phase 4 - Confidence Moments

- Surviving first creeper explosion.
- First successful cave run.
- Standing under night sky for several seconds (rare line).
- First time sleeping safely through night.

## Design Principle

Build features in the order a child naturally encounters them in survival mode. Test each phase organically during real gameplay sessions before expanding further.
